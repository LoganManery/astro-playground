**Meet Logan Manery** 
Hey there! I`'`m Logan from the vibrant city of Kitchener, ON. Born in the tech golden year of 1992 (when Windows 3.1 was the hottest thing around), I`'`ve evolved way faster than the floppy disk. Today, I'm a keen lifelong learner, swaying between the world of Python scripts and power tools. Just another day in the life of a tech enthusiast!

**Drop Me a Line!** 
Kitchener, ON N2B 3X1

While I`'`m old enough to remember the“dial`-`up internet” symphony, I`'`m young enough to know my JavaScript from my Java (one`'`s essential for my web work, the other for my morning caffeine kick!). I proudly wear the badge of a Computer Programming student at Conestoga College. But wait, there`'`s more! I`'`m not just about ones and zeros; I have some hands-on know-how with electrical systems. After all, you can`'`t spell "electric" without "elite", right? 

**The Day Job(s):** 
Currently, I'm the "Bowling Machine Whisperer" at Bingemans in Kitchener. I can convince a malfunctioning machine to behave with just a stern look...and sometimes a bit of mechanical wizardry. My past roles at Rockwell Automation and Brock Solutions saw me channeling my inner Tony Stark, minus the Iron Man suit, of course. ///

**Learning Never Stops:**
From high school at Grand River Collegiate to now, I've had quite the academic tour. Dabbled in Electrical Engineering at Conestoga College, added a Google IT Support Professional Certificate to my trophy case, and now I'm leveling up with Computer Programming. With every new challenge, my motto remains: "Just another bug to squash!"

**Tech Toolbox:**
Got a tech problem? There's a high chance I've got a tool (or code) for that! Whether it's wrangling databases with MongoDB, jazzing up websites with React, or going full detective mode on network security, I've got it covered. And if a machine acts up? Let's just say I know how to "turn it off and on again" with style.

**Speaking Geek:**
I converse fluently in tech and, of course, English. Looking for a "Hello, World!" in multiple programming languages? You're in for a treat!

**The Cert to Flaunt:**
Wearing the Google IT Support Professional Certificate like a badge of honor. It's like getting a thumbs up from the tech giants themselves!

**Wanna Connect?**
Slide into my [LinkedIn DMs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-manery-4a80401b8/). I promise I'm friendlier than an error-free code on a Monday morning!
