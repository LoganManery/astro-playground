I&#39;m Logan from the vibrant city of Kitchener, ON. Born in the tech golden year of 1992 (when Windows 3.1 was the hottest thing around), I&#39;ve evolved way faster than the floppy disk. Today, I&#39;m a keen lifelong learner, swaying between the world of Python scripts and power tools. Just another day in the life of a tech enthusiast!</p><h2></h2><p>While I&#39;m old enough to remember the “dial-up internet” symphony, I&#39;m young enough to know my JavaScript from my Java (one&#39;s essential for my web work, the other for my morning caffeine kick!). I proudly wear the badge of a Computer Programming student at Conestoga College. But wait, there&#39;s more! I&#39;m not just about ones and zeros; I have some hands-on know-how with electrical systems. After all, you can&#39;t spell &quot;electric&quot; without &quot;elite&quot;, right? </p><h2>Experience</h2><p>Currently, I&#39;m the &quot;Bowling Machine Whisperer&quot; at Bingemans in Kitchener. I can convince a malfunctioning machine to behave with just a stern look...and sometimes a bit of mechanical wizardry. My past roles at Rockwell Automation and Brock Solutions saw me channeling my inner Tony Stark, minus the Iron Man suit, of course.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>From high school at Grand River Collegiate to now, I&#39;ve had quite the academic tour. Dabbled in Electrical Engineering at Conestoga College, added a Google IT Support Professional Certificate to my trophy case, and now I&#39;m leveling up with Computer Programming. With every new challenge, my motto remains: &quot;Just another bug to squash!&quot;</p><h2>Skills</h2><p>Got a tech problem? There&#39;s a high chance I&#39;ve got a tool (or code) for that! Whether it&#39;s wrangling databases with MongoDB, jazzing up websites with React, or going full detective mode on network security, I&#39;ve got it covered. And if a machine acts up? Let&#39;s just say I know how to &quot;turn it off and on again&quot; with style. I converse fluently in tech and, of course, English. Looking for a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in multiple programming languages? You&#39;re in for a treat! Wearing the Google IT Support Professional Certificate like a badge of honor. It&#39;s like getting a thumbs up from the tech giants themselves!</p><p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p><p>I have not finished this tutorial.</p><p>my goal is to finish in 3 days.</p><h1>Contact Me</h1><p>Kitchener, ON</p><p>logan.j.manery@gmail.com</p><footer><p>Learn more about my projects on <a href="https://www.github.com/LoganManery">github</a>!</p></footer></body></html>
